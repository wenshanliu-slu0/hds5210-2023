# Week 9 Feedback
Each week, you'll receive a feedback file in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.

This assignment was focused on the use of Python and Pandas to load and visualize data, giving you something to interpret and help you understand the data. You did not nee to encapsulate your code in functions or provide docstrings/doctests in your functions.


## Final Score: 10/10


## First Half: Interpretation and Feedback
* 1pt - 41.1 - Correctly identified a trend in data based on the histograms.
* 1pt - 41.2 - Correctly explained that cash price tends to be less than expected reimbursement, and both are less than charges
* 1pt - 41.3 - Correctly saw that Aetna has lowest reimbursement, followed by Allwell and AR Blue
* 1pt - 41.4 - Correctly say there was an almost perfect linear relationship between Cash and Expected for Healthscope and Multiplan; a weaker correlation for Aetna, Allwell, and AR Blue; probably no correlation with AR Total Care

## Second Half: 41.5
* 2pts - Loaded data and created a visualization
* 1pt - Wrote a good observation
* 2pt - Created another visualization
* 1pt - Wrote a good observation


## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
* Good variable names?
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
* Appropriate comments with your code?
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
