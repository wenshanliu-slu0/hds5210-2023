# Week 4 Feedback
Like your weekly assignments, your feedback on this quiz is provided as `quiz_feedback.md` in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.

A big reason for doing this quiz during class was to see what you are able to do one your own without talking to other students. I gave clear instructions that you were NOT to collaborate with others and that the work you submit was to be your own.  If you used ChatGPT or another resource and clearly copied and pasted that work, you will lose all of the points for the first part of this quiz.

## Final Score: 13/20

## Functionality: 
_Did your code do what the assignment required?_
* All code worked as expected
  * **(-2) You only provided 2 tests in your docstrings, where the instructions clearly required 5.**
  * **(-2) Your docstring was not descriptive enough for a reader to understand what it does.  It does not just `calculate the MAP` as stated in your documentation.**
  * **From a style perspective, your code has many extra steps.  For example `if severe_sepsis == True:` could just be `if severe_sepsis:` and the alternative could just be `else:`.  Also, instead of `if map >= 60: return True...` you could just say `return map >= 60`.**

## Fill in the blank:
_Did you answer the data type questions correctly?_
* All data types questions were answered correctly
  * **(-3) You answered what you thought the data was for those references rather than the object TYPE. Some of them were incorrect.**

## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
* Good variable names?
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
* Appropriate comments with your code?
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
